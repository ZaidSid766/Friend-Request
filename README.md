# Ask For Friend

A simple and interactive webpage that prompts users with a fun "Yes" or "No" choice. When a user hovers over the "No" button, it randomly moves around the screen, while clicking "Yes" reveals a hidden image. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button evades the user's cursor when hovered over, creating a playful interaction.
- **Image Toggle**: Clicking "Yes" hides the first image and displays another, providing feedback to the user.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout and elements adapt for different screen sizes.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure, including references to CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css`: Contains all styling for the webpage, including button styles and responsive design.
- `main.js`: JavaScript functionality, handling button interactions and image toggling.

## Setup

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view and interact with the project.

## Usage
